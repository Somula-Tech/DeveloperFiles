#Kubernetes deployment commands

A container orchestration system — it defines how containers are deployed, scaled, and managed across multiple machines (nodes).

Kubectl get nodes

kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml

kubectl apply -f service.yaml

kubectl get pods

kubectl get svc(services)

Controller(It will take care of how many pods to be run)
Schedular(It will take care of pods need to run in which node and all)
Kubelet(It will take care of Docker images)

#Automation process of deployment using Kubernetes
creating manifestfile 
And add all the details of deployment.yaml and service.yaml and try to add the command kubectl apply -f deployment/service.yaml

deployment.yaml(#this file will take care of how many pods need to be run and if pod crashes and immediately take the another pod up)
Purpose:	Run & manage Pods 
Description:	Defines the app’s container image, replicas, and update strategy
“How to run my app.”

service.yaml
Purpose:	Expose Pods 
Description:	Gives stable access to your app over the network
“How to access my app.”

Service Type		Accessible From				Used In						Typical Use Case
ClusterIP			Inside cluster only			Local, internal services		Backend, DB
NodePort			External (limited)			Local / Minikube					Development, testing
LoadBalancer		Internet (public IP)	Cloud clusters				Production apps

Minikube = Local practice version of Kubernetes
Kubernetes = Real distributed system for production
